### Project Ideas (1000 words)
-    Overview (100 words)
My project is a paintball turret that will target my friends once they enter certain proximity to my front door, the paintball turret will open fire. This will be a great deterrence as paintballs hurt especially up close (I know this from experience). The turret will use a variety of sensors such as infra-red and camera’s that have a pre-loaded program that can detect and track my friends. This is to ensure that the turret has a wider area of operation then if the cameras and sensors did not have tracking capabilities, a universal turret mount will increase the capability of deterrence that can be inflicted upon my friends.

-    Motivation (100 words)
The motivation of this project came from my shy, slightly nature and the fact this project will be hilarious. This will also be amazing as I’ll have field test the paintball turret’s accuracy and pain on myself before I can employ it in the field to ensure maximum effective deterrence of the project. Also, the idea of finding method of hiding the turret in plain slight even some ideas may be challenging but that’s the idea of it. For example, the idea of hiding the turret inside of plant pot (which we have conveniently placed in front of my house between the front and garage door). These such ideas give me the enthusiasm to think and possibly design a project like this.

-    Description (500 words)
The turret will be programmed with the open source facial detection software that can be programmed with the faces of my friends. This will be done by mapping the facial features of my friends so that the turret can only target them, as false targeting is not acceptable. I can also make it so that the turret can also track the height of my friend (as this can be a primary key in identifying the person and especially since my friends all have similar height range). Although I do have to overcome changes such as sunglasses, hats and maybe heavy amounts of make-up which can mess up the facial feature which means I’ll have to improve the quality of the code to minimize or completely remove the effects of makeup and hats. 
 The turret should also be placed in an area where it can operate effectively, although extra work will have to be done as I have a method of hiding the opening of the turret, as a black line on pot plant will seem very spacious.

-    Tools and Technologies (100 words)
I’ll need a wide variety of tool and gadgets to complete this project. These tools and gadgets range from simple hammers, nails and screwdrivers to more complex machines and beautiful such as open source facial tracking software and remote triggers. This equipment will either be sourced from home, local shops or brought from online retailers, 3D printing parts may also be a feasible option as previous endeavours have demonstrated how hard it is to find the right part for jobs as well as the need for custom parts in these projects.

-    Skills Required (100 words)
The skills required are out of reach for me at this current time as I am unaware of the program complexity to run facial tracking software as well as the ability to trigger the device at the right intervals or else it will jam the compressed air firing mechanism of the paintball gun (which will then require the disassembly of firing mechanism to clean the jam) .

-    Outcome (100 words)
The result of this project should be a turret that can successfully identify and track my friends. The turret should also be able to identify friend and foe, be also able to track and fire at foes.
